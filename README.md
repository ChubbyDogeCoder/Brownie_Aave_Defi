=>  So this is the Way to automate Defi_ #Quant Defi engeneer:

    0. Swap our ETH for wETH
    1. So we deposit some ETH (wETH) to AAVE, as collateral
    2. Borrow some assets with our deposited collateral
        1. Sell that borrowed asset (Short selling, hopefully for a profit)
    3. Repay everything back
    4. Happy developer here ^^


    
Testing:

    * Integration test: Kovan
    * Unit tests : Mainnet-fork
